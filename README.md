# TypeScript

Skeleton project for TypeScript (via NodeJS) with Jest for testing.

## Usage
- `./script/setup` to install dependencies
- `./script/test` to run the tests

### Other commands
- `yarn watch` will constantly compile `index.ts` then execute the compiled version on every file change (for quick development feedback loop) using [tsc-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsc-watch) under the hood.

## Structure
- Code located in [`index.ts`](./src/index.ts)
- Tests located in [`index.test.ts`](./src/index.test.ts)

However, you're free to organise your code as you like.
